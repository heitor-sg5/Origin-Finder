# Origin Search Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of several bioinformatics algorithms to find frequent k-mers with mismatches, clumps of k-mers, and origin of replication (ori) regions in genomic sequences using GC skew and mismatch-tolerant k-mer counting.

## üß¨ What is the Ori?

The origin of replication (ori) is a specific region in the genome where DNA replication begins. In bacteria, this region often contains conserved motifs such as DnaA boxes ‚Äî short, recurring DNA sequences (k-mers) that signal the start of replication. Identifying these motifs helps pinpoint the ori location.

Another useful feature for locating the ori is the GC skew ‚Äî the imbalance between guanine (G) and cytosine (C) nucleotides along the DNA strand. This skew tends to shift near the origin, providing a genomic landmark.

By combining GC skew analysis with searching for frequent k-mers allowing mismatches, this algorithm improves the accuracy of ori prediction.

## üìÅ Files in This Repository

- `frequent_kmers_with_mismatches.py`: Finds frequent k-mers allowing up to d mismatches.
- `clump_finding.py`: Detects clumps of frequent k-mers within genomic windows.
- `ori_finder_with_gc_skew.py`: Locates origin of replication regions using GC skew and approximate k-mer matching.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

### 1. Prepare Input

Input DNA sequences should be provided as plain text strings or FASTA files (for the ori finder file).

### 2. Run the Algorithms

Each script reads from the input file and prints:

- The **frequent k-mers** (pattern)
- The **counts**
- The **windows** were the k-mers are found

---

#### Frequent k-mer with Mismatches

  bash
```python frequent_kmers_with_mismatches.py```

#### Clump Finding

  bash
```python clump_finding.py```

#### Ori Finder with GC Skew

  bash
```python ori_finder_with_gc_skew.py```

Parameters like k (k-mer length), d (allowed mismatches), t (threshold count), and L (window length) are defined within each script but can be adjusted for your needs.

## üß† Algorithm Overviews

### Frequent k-mers with Mismatches

- Computes the frequency of all k-mers allowing up to d mismatches.
- Uses a neighborhood generation approach and mapping between k-mers and numbers.
- Returns the k-mers with the highest approximate frequency.
- Time complexity: O(n * k * 3^d + 4^k)

### Clump Finding

- Scans a genome with a sliding window of length L.
- Finds k-mers appearing at least t times within any window (forming clumps).
- Efficiently updates frequency counts when sliding the window.
- Time complexity: O(n * k + 4^k)

### Ori Finder with GC Skews

- Computes GC skew to locate potential replication origin regions.
- Within L windows around minimum GC skew, finds frequent k-mers with mismatches.
- Uses a simple GUI to load FASTA files and display results.
- Time complexity: O(n * k + N * 3^d * k)
