# Origin Search Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of several bioinformatics algorithms to find frequent k-mers with mismatches, clumps of k-mers, and origin of replication (ori) regions in genomic sequences using GC skew and mismatch-tolerant k-mer counting.

## üß¨ What is the Ori?

The origin of replication (ori) is a specific region in the genome where DNA replication begins. In bacteria, this region often contains conserved motifs such as DnaA boxes ‚Äî short, recurring DNA sequences (k-mers) that signal the start of replication. Identifying these motifs helps pinpoint the ori location.

Another useful feature for locating the ori is the GC skew ‚Äî the imbalance between guanine (G) and cytosine (C) nucleotides along the DNA strand. This skew tends to shift near the origin, providing a genomic landmark.

By combining GC skew analysis with searching for frequent k-mers allowing mismatches, this algorithm improves the accuracy of ori prediction.

## üìÅ Files in This Repository

- `frequent_kmers_with_mismatches.py`: Finds frequent k-mers allowing up to d mismatches.
- `clump_finding.py`: Detects clumps of frequent k-mers within genomic windows.
- `ori_finder_with_gc_skew.py`: Locates origin of replication regions using GC skew and approximate k-mer matching.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

### 1. Prepare Input

Input DNA sequences should be provided as plain text strings or FASTA files (for the ori finder file).

### 2. Run the Algorithms

Each script reads from the input file and prints:

- The **consensus motif**
- The **score** (lower score = better consensus)
- The list of **best motifs** found

---

#### Greedy Motif Search

  bash
```python greedy_motif_search_with_pseudocounts.py```

#### Randomized Motif Search

  bash
```python randomized_motif_search.py```

#### Gibbs Sampler Motif Search 

  bash
```python randomized_motif_search_with_gibbs_sampler.py```

You can change the default parameters (k, t, and N) directly in each script's function call at the bottom.

## üß† Algorithm Overviews

### Greedy Motif Search

- Iteratively builds a motif set by choosing the most probable k-mer using a profile.
- Fast and deterministic, but may get stuck in local optima.

### Randomized Motif Search

- Starts with random k-mers, updates motifs using profiles until convergence.
- Repeated multiple times to improve chances of a better result.

### Gibbs Sampling

- Iteratively refines motifs by randomly sampling one at a time based on profiles.
- Often yields better motifs with enough iterations.
